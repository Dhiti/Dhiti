            My hobby is painting. I love painting about nature. Nature is something I have loved ever since childhood. So, I paint forests, mountain regions, birds and flowers. The colour base that I use are Charcoal Pencils, Acrylic Paints and Colour Pencils. Painting acts as a stress-reliever. On a day that I am bored, music, paint-brush, paint and paper is all I need to keep myself busy.
